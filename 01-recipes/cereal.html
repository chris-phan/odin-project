					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p class="description-text">
						There will be no jokes for this recipe since this is a
						very serious topic. The age old debate on whether cereal
						should be pour first or if milk should be poured first
						has gone on for far too long and needs to be settled. I
						will be representing the side of the milk firsters and
						by the end of this, you will have to be missing at least
						72% of your brain mass to still be on the side of the
						cereal firsters. My argument is composed of two parts.
						Firstly, pouring milk first means that when you are
						ready to pour the cereal into the bowl, you will pour a
						small amount each time to ensure that the cereal stays
						crispy and doesn't end up as a soggy mess. In this
						method, the milk to cereal ratio is high as opposed to
						pouring milk into your cereal where it is incredibly
						easy to pour too much milk, making your cereal have the
						texture of pre-chewed food or your cereal has too little
						milk, making some parts of your cereal dry and hard and
						others soggy and frankly disgusting. Those that never
						pour cereal into milk either never go for a second
						serving of cereal or drink all the milk before pouring
						cereal into an empty bowl. If you are the latter, I'm
						afraid that you have fallen victim to my trap as the
						only possible down side of pouring milk first is that
						you may end up with left over milk, but if you enjoy
						drinking the milk at the end, there is no downside for
						being a milk firster. All in all, pouring milk first
						leaves you with more options as you can easily go for
						seconds and you also have more room for error since it
						is much easier to pour a little bit of cereal at a time
						versus pouring the exact right amount of milk the first
						time if you are a disgusting, vile, ignorant, and
						criminal cereal firster. Secondly, people that pour
						cereal first have been found to be highly coorelated to
						premature balding and stinky breath.
