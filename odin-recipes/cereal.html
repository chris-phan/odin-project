		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			There will be no jokes for this recipe since this is a very serious
			topic. The age old debate on whether cereal should be pour first or
			if milk should be poured first has gone on for far too long and
			needs to be settled. I will be representing the side of the milk
			firsters and by the end of this, you will have to be missing at
			least 72% of your brain mass to still be on the side of the cereal
			firsters. My argument is composed of two parts. Firstly, pouring
			milk first means that when you are ready to pour the cereal into the
			bowl, you will pour a small amount each time to ensure that the
			cereal stays crispy and doesn't end up as a soggy mess. In this
			method, the milk to cereal ratio is high as opposed to pouring milk
			into your cereal where it is incredibly easy to pour too much milk,
			making your cereal have the texture of pre-chewed food or your
			cereal has too little milk, making some parts of your cereal dry and
			hard and others soggy and frankly disgusting. Those that never pour
			cereal into milk either never go for a second serving of cereal or
			drink all the milk before pouring cereal into an empty bowl. If you
			are the latter, I'm afraid that you have fallen victim to my trap as
			the only possible down side of pouring milk first is that you may
			end up with left over milk, but if you enjoy drinking the milk at
			the end, there is no downside for being a milk firster. All in all,
			pouring milk first leaves you with more options as you can easily go
			for seconds and you also have more room for error since it is much
			easier to pour a little bit of cereal at a time versus pouring the
			exact right amount of milk the first time if you are a disgusting,
			vile, ignorant, and criminal cereal firster. Secondly, people that
			pour cereal first have been found to be highly coorelated to
			premature balding and stinky breath.
