					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p class="description-text">
						Water is one of the most obscure drinks in the entire
						world. According to a survey conducted in 2017 with over
						500,000,000 participants, all of which were American
						honey bees, it was found that 100% of respondants said
						that water was the last thing that they would ever
						drink. This survey has been the subject of much
						controversy and has caused the global population of
						humans to band together and reject water, choosing to
						drink Pepsi instead. Due to this unprecedented shift in
						public opinion, I thought that it would only be right to
						document these events and give an honest and informed
						recipe on how water is made illegally in the black
						markets of Davis, California.

			*Note: Since writing this article, I have been informed by an
			anonymous source that the best way to gather water is by using a
			bucket tool. I will leave a transcript of the email correspondence
			below:

			Christopher,<br /><br />
			&emsp; We of the Society of Merchants of Clear Fluid have found
			after 23 years of extensive research that the most efficient way to
			collect water is through the use of what we have chosen to call a
			"bucket", named after the great pioneer and widely respected Bill
			Buck Licker-Et IV. We have found that the bucket maintains the ideal
			weight for long trecks from the pockets water to the our underground
			lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico while also keeping the temperature of
			the water at an ideal 614 degrees Kelvin. If you wish to know more,
			send me a picture of you in Paris with a jump rope in your right
			hand and a snickers bar in your left. <br /><br />
